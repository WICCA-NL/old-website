      <description>Great news!!! The organisers of hardwear.io have invited us for a special women-only session on hardware security!
Hardwear.io is the biggest hardware security conference in Europe, and possibly in the world. It is a platform where researchers showcase and discuss their innovative research on attacking and defending hardware.

This session takes place during the hardwear.io week, right after the trainings and before the official conference starts, directly at the venue in The Hague WTC.</description>
