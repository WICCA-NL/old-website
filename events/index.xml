Great news!!! The organisers of hardwear.io have invited us to their after-training reception.
Hardwear.io is the biggest hardware security conference in Europe, and possibly in the world. It is a platform where researchers showcase and discuss their innovative research on attacking and defending hardware.

This event takes place during the hardwear.io week, right after the trainings and before the official conference starts, directly at the venue in The Hague WTC.</description>
