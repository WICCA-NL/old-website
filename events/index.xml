      <description>Wed, Nov 27, 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM Location: ING HUB
ING is inviting WICCA to their awesome open-for-all CTF!
How to teach anyone to be a hacker
Normally, Capture the Flag (CTF) events are organised for security enthusiasts only. This means that non-technical people are often overlooked and remain in the dark. In this session, ING will show you how you can use CTF events to teach anyone a basic level of hacking so they can defend themselves better against threats in their daily life.</description>
