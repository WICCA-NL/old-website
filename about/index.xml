      <description>What is WICCA? WICCA is a circle of women in cybersecurity based out in Amsterdam and surroundings with a vision to spread the infosec word to everyone.
Our goal is to bring infosec ladies and female security enthusiasts together to learn about exploits, hacking, incident response, forensics, the low-level stuff, and especially make bad crypto jokes! We want to build a community of badass women in the Netherlands and hopefully inspire future generations to join keyboards and get the hacking started!</description>
