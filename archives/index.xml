Are you a woman working or interested in computer security? Sign up!
It&amp;rsquo;s time to kickoff the WICCA initiative with a casual get together, inviting the ladies of InfoSec and female security enthusiasts in The Netherlands to join us in Amsterdam. We will introduce ourselves and present on computer security-related topics, but most of all, make bad crypto jokes.
KPN will be hosting us at their office by Amsterdam Sloterdijk and is providing free (vegan) pizza.</description>
