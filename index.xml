Great news!!! The organisers of hardwear.io have invited us for a special women-only session on hardware security!
Hardwear.io is the biggest hardware security conference in Europe, and possibly in the world. It is a platform where researchers showcase and discuss their innovative research on attacking and defending hardware.

This session takes place during the hardwear.io week, right after the trainings and before the official conference starts, directly at the venue in The Hague WTC.</description>

      <description>What is WICCA? WICCA is a circle of women in cybersecurity based out in Amsterdam and surroundings with a vision to spread the infosec word to everyone.
Our goal is to bring infosec ladies and female security enthusiasts together to learn about exploits, hacking, incident response, forensics, the low-level stuff, and especially make bad crypto jokes! We want to build a community of badass women in the Netherlands and hopefully inspire future generations to join keyboards and get the hacking started!</description>
